    "### Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "Molecular dynamics simulation is a common and powerful technique in computational chemistry/statistical physics for the determination of equilibrium & transport properties of many-body systems. These systems consist of particles interacting through force-fields, whose motions are described by classical Newtonian mechanics, for molecular dynamics this comes down to two equations,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\mathbf{r}(t+\\Delta t) = \\mathbf{r}(t) + \\mathbf{v}(t)\\Delta t + \\dfrac{1}{2} \\mathbf{a}(t)\\Delta t^2, $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where, $\\mathbf{r}(t)$ is the position, $\\mathbf{v}(t)$ is the velocity, and $\\mathbf{a}(t)$ is the acceleration of the particle at a given time $t$, while $\\mathbf{r}(t+\\Delta t)$ is the position after the timestep, $\\Delta t$, and, \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\mathbf{f}(t) = m\\mathbf{a}(t), $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mathbf{f}(t)$ is the force on some particle at time $t$, and $m$ is the particle mass.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally speaking the use of classical mechanics compared to quantum mechanics is a very good approximation for many molecular materials, where quantum mechanical effects are weak -- these only become significant for very light atoms, e.g. $\\text{H}_2$ or $\\text{He}_2$ molecules. \n",
    "\n",
    "A molecular dynamics simulation can be considered in a similar way to a real experiment. A general recipe for a real experiment would be: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Prepare the sample -- buy the constituent chemicals and mix them approporiately to get your single crystal of a photovoltaic material, grow and purify the protein in deuterared medium, etc. \n",
    "2. Allow the sample to interact with some measuring instrument -- fly to the ILL and put the sample on D9, bring it to ISIS and put it on SANS2D.\n",
    "3. Finally, measure some property of the sample for a given time -- collect the diffraction, or SANS pattern until the counting is good. \n",
    "\n",
    "A similar recipe can be applied to a molecular dynamics simulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Prepare the sample -- build the particle coordinates, determine a suitable force-field and equilibriate the sample by solving Newton's equations of motion until some property of the system no longer changes beyond random fluctuations.\n",
    "2. Allow the sample to interact with some measuring instrument -- within molecular dynamics this involves determining a quantity that can be measured as a function of the positions, velocities, and accelerations of the particles. \n",
    "3. Finally, measure that property of the sample for a given time -- this means calculating Newton's equations of motion iteratively, for a long enough time that good statistics can be obtained of the measurement quantity. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to be aware that this means that the problems present in real experiments are possible in molecular dynamics simulations; preparing the sample incorrectly by using an inaccurate force field, or measuring for too short a time. \n",
    "\n",
    "For using molecular dynamics simulation to understand neutron scattering, the property that is being measured in the simulation should be as similar as possible to that measured in the neutron experiment. For example, small angle neutron scattering (SANS) measured the position of clusters of atoms with respect to each other, therefore to determine a SANS profile from molecular simulation we must sample the atomic coordinates during the molecular dynamics simulation. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Force-fields \n",
    "\n",
    "In molecular dynamics, the electrons are not explicitly simulated, instead the system is modelled as a series of point particles that interact based on some *force-field*. The force-field is a function that describes the potential energy, $u$, for a given configuration of the system, typically for a molecular system this consists of bonded and non-bonded components, \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ u = u_{\\text{bonded}} + u_{\\text{non-bonded}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The potential energy depends on the functions used, their parameterisation and the configuration of the system at a given time. The functions and their parameterisation depend on the underlying chemistry of the system, the particular functions that are described herein are those associated with the OPLS2005 force field.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Non-bonded interactions \n",
    "\n",
    "In the OPLS2005 force-field, two forms of non-bonded interaction are present, van der Waals and Coulombic. The van der Waals interaction is modelled with a Lennard-Jones potential, and has the following form, \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ u_{\\text{vdW}} = 4\\epsilon_{ij}\\Bigg[\\bigg(\\frac{\\sigma_{ij}}{\\mathbf{r}_{ij}}\\bigg)^{12} - \\bigg(\\frac{\\sigma_{ij}}{\\mathbf{r}_{ij}}\\bigg)^6\\Bigg], $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where, $\\epsilon_{ij}$ and $\\sigma_{ij}$ are parameters specific to the interaction, hence the atom types, such that the van der Waals interaction vaires with distance between atoms, $\\mathbf{r}_{ij}$. The Coulombic interaction is that between ions, modelled with a Coulombic potential, \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ u_{\\text{Coulombic}} = \\frac{q_iq_j}{4\\pi\\epsilon\\mathbf{r}_{ij}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where, $q_i$ and $q_j$ are the charges on the interacting particles -- it should be noted that the charge does not need to be an integer essentially allowing for the presense of polarity, and $\\epsilon$ is the permittivity of the solvent. The Lennard-Jones, Coulombic, and total non-bonded potentials for a sodium-chloride ion pair are determined an shown below. "

    "The purpose of molecular simulation for neutron scattering is to reproduce the properties of some experimental system. However, current computational systems cannot efficiently model such large systems -- limited to about 10s of millions of particles ($1\\times10^{-17}$ moles).[2] Therefore simplications must be made; the most routinely applied is that of the periodic box. This is where a boundary condition is applied to the edges of the simulation box to mimic an infinite system -- by creating the situation that the simulation box is surrounded by infinite identical images of itself.[3] This is achieved by having a particle that reaches the edge of the simulation box appear on the other side of the box; as though it came in from the adjecent periodic image. Additionally, when the force is calculated on each particle, the periodic nature is considered and if particles are more than half of the box apart, it is recognised that they are closer by replacing one of the particles with that from the adjacent periodic image. This shorter distance is then used in the force calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is an interactive example that shows a single particle that has been given some initial velocity in a random direction. It will travel across the periodic boundary of the simulation box appearing on the other side. The first number (initially 10000) is the number of steps in the simulation, while the second number (initially 50) is the temperature of the particle, in Kelvin. "

    "The initialisation process involves getting the starting positions and velocities for the particles in the system. Generally speaking the initial positions are system dependent and can be obtained from a source or generated using appropriate software. For example, the simulations of proteins often involves taking a starting structure from the Protein Data Bank [4] crystallographic information, this requires a crystal structure of the protein to have been resolved. Other methods would include generating energy minimised structures *in-silico*, e.g. with Jmol, [5] and orienting the structures appropriately using a program such as Packmol. [6]\n",
    "In the above 2D example the initial positions were generated by placing the particles on a square lattice, however the particles could also be placed in random positions. However, this may be problematic as some particles may be too close to others, resulting in the simulation \"exploding\". Therefore it is necessary to preform some energy minimsation which usually takes the form of a steepest descent algorithm. This is not discussed in detail herein, however Frenkel and Smith [3] has detail for the interested reader. \n",

If the particles are further apart in a particular direction than half the length of the simulation box in that dimension the periodic boundary correction is applied; where one of the particles is swapped with that from an adjacent image, such that the particles are closer together. At this stage, the system cut-off is also applied, this is where if the particles are beyond a certain distance apart, the force that they apply on each other is considered to be effectively zero so the energy and force are not calculated -- this is a method of improving the speed of the force calculation. \n",

For simulations containing explicitly modelled hydrogen atoms, the time-step should be 1 fs as a maximum. Larger time-steps can be accessed using coarse-grained force-fields such as MARTINI, or by fixing the positions of the hydrogen atoms with respect to the heavy atom to which it is bound.\n",

    "Similar to the number of force-fields, there are also a wide range of molecular dynamics software packages available -- the choice of software can depend on personal preference and what is being simulated. Common molecular dynamics software include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- LAMMPS -- possible the most common molecular dynamics package due to the flexibility offered, popular amoung hardcore theoreticians.\n",
    "- NAMD -- popular package from the USA for the simulation of biological systems in particular.\n",
    "- GROMACS -- effectively the European challenger to NAMD, popular for coarse-grained simulation due to the inclusion of the MARTINI force-field. \n",

    "Shown below is a molecular dynamics simulation, from which the neutron scattering/diffraction profile is being determined. The scattering is found from a Fourier transform of the radial distribution function, however could also be found by the Debye relation. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ I(q) = \\sum_j^N \\sum_k^N b_jb_k \\frac{sin(q|\\mathbf{r}_j - \\mathbf{r}_k|)}{q|\\mathbf{r}_j - \\mathbf{r}_k|}, $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $b_j$ and $b_k$ are the scattering length densities of particles $j$ and $k$, $\\mathbf{r}_j$ and $\\mathbf{r}_k$ are the positions of particles $j$ and $k$, $q$ is the scattering vector, and $I(q)$ is the determined intensity. It is possible to use this to observe phase transitions in simulation by varying the temperature, pressure or volume and considering the sharpness of the peaks in the scattering profile. "
